Add the tenant identifier to the hosts file.

In windows find your hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\ folder

1) Add the following lists at the end fo the file:

127.0.0.1       tenant1.local
127.0.0.1       tenant2.local

2) Save and exit, then from the command line execute the following command

ipconfig /flushdns

You computer will now recognize tenant1.local and tenant2.local as alternative for your tenant test sites. 

When you launch the site, feel free to replace localhost with any of the your new tenants urls to test it.
